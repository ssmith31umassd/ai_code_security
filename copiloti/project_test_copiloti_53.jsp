## Step 4: Create the project in Eclipse

Now that we have the project files, we can create a new project in Eclipse and import the existing files.

1. Open Eclipse.
2. Go to `File` > `New` > `Dynamic Web Project`.
3. Enter a project name (e.g. `project_test_copiloti_53`).
4. Uncheck the box for "Use default location" and browse to the directory where you extracted the project files.
5. Click `Finish`.
6. Right-click on the project in the Project Explorer and select `Refresh`.
7. You should now see the project files in the Project Explorer.

## Step 5: Run the project in a web browser

Now that the project is set up in Eclipse, you can run it in a web browser to see the output.

1. Right-click on the project in the Project Explorer and select `Run As` > `Run on Server`.
2. Choose a server (e.g. Apache Tomcat) and click `Next`.
3. Click `Finish`.
4. The project should open in a web browser with a form to enter a username. Enter a name and click `Submit`.
5. You should see a greeting message with the entered username displayed.
